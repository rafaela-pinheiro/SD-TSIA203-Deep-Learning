# Graph Learning (CSC_4AI07-TP)
## Course overview
This repository contains code and resources for the **Introduction to Deep Learning** course. The objective of the course is to provide a theoretical understanding and a practical usage of the three main types of networks (Multi-Layer- Perceptron, Recurrent-Neural-Network and Convolutional Neural Network) and the main generative paradigms (GAN and VAE). Students learn to implement these networks using the PyTorch and Keras frameworks.
